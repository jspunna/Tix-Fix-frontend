This project was created, in collaboration with 2 other classmates, as a full stack website designed to mock the functionality of a ticketing website like Ticketmaster or Seatgeek. The site utilizes Seatgeeks API to retrieve events and their details. The site, our submission for our Web Dev course final project, was built in approx. 2 weeks.

The site was was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).The styling of the site was built using Bootstrap and CSS. Data is stored and retrieved using MongoDB and mongoose. The backend uses Node.js and Express. The frontend is hosted on Netlify and the backend is deployed using Heroku.
